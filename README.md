# Advent of Code 2021

[This repository](https://github.com/debemdeboas/advent-of-code-2021) contains
all my answers to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

I am aware that the inputs/examples from each day are (for now) the same file,
but I have made a copy for each sub-challenge for simplicity.

Made with Python 3.10.
